However, as you pointed out, definitions can be ambiguous and open to interpretation, leading to controversies. Establishing a universally accepted definition that resonates with the majority of society is a challenging task. Here are some possible approaches to consider:\n\n1. **Consensus-building through dialogue**: Encourage open and inclusive discussions among stakeholders, including legal experts, policymakers, and representatives from diverse social groups. This can help identify common ground and areas of agreement, ultimately leading to a more widely accepted definition.\n2. **Empirical research and data analysis**: Conduct thorough research and analysis of relevant data to inform the definition. This can involve studying the concept in question, its historical context, and its impact on various social groups. By grounding the definition in empirical evidence, it can be more objective and less prone to subjective interpretations.\n3. **Iterative refinement**: Develop a definition through an iterative process of refinement, where the initial definition is tested, critiqued, and revised based on feedback from various stakeholders. This approach can help identify and address potential flaws or biases in the definition.\n4. **Multidisciplinary approaches**: Engage experts from various fields, such as philosophy, sociology, psychology, and anthropology, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the concept. This can help identify the underlying principles and values that should inform the definition.\n5. **International cooperation and comparative analysis**: Study how different countries and legal systems approach the concept in question, and identify commonalities and differences. This can help develop a more universal definition that takes into account diverse perspectives and experiences.\n6. **Participatory governance**: Involve citizens and stakeholders in the definition-making process through participatory governance mechanisms, such as citizen juries, deliberative polling, or crowdsourcing. This can increase the legitimacy and acceptance of the definition among the broader population.\n7. **Flexibility and adaptability**: Recognize that definitions may need to evolve over time as societal values, norms, and contexts change. Build in mechanisms for periodic review and revision to ensure the definition remains relevant and effective.\n8. **Transparency and accountability**: Ensure that the definition-making process is transparent, and the reasoning behind the definition is clearly articulated. This can help build trust and confidence in the definition among stakeholders.\n9. **Education and awareness**: Educate the public about the importance of the concept and the definition, and promote awareness of its implications and consequences. This can help increase understanding and acceptance of the definition.\n10. **Continuous evaluation and monitoring**: Regularly evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of the definition in practice, and make adjustments as needed. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure the definition remains relevant and effective over time.\n\nBy combining these approaches, it may be possible to develop a more universally accepted definition that resonates with the majority of society. However, it's essential to recognize that achieving a perfect definition may be an ongoing process, and that ongoing dialogue, refinement, and adaptation will be necessary to ensure the definition remains relevant and effective. 💡","Here is a summary of my previous response in three English sentences:\n\n\"Establishing a universally accepted definition requires a multifaceted approach that involves consensus-building, empirical research, and iterative refinement. A definition should be flexible and adaptable to accommodate changing societal values and norms. Transparency, accountability, and continuous evaluation are essential to ensure the definition remains effective and relevant over time.\"\n\nAnd here are three words from these sentences with their meanings:\n\n1. **Multifaceted**: (adjective) Having many different aspects or features; complex and varied. In this context, a multifaceted approach means considering multiple perspectives and methods to establish a definition.\n2. **Iterative**: (adjective) Relating to a process of repeating a cycle of operations or steps, with the aim of achieving a desired result. In this context, iterative refinement means refining the definition through a series of cycles of testing, critiquing, and revising.\n3. **Accommodate**: (verb) To provide something, such as a need or a request, with a willingness to help or compromise. In this context, a definition should be able to accommodate changing societal values and norms, meaning it should be flexible and adaptable to fit new circumstances."],"references":[null,null]}

Each switch corresponds to one of the light bulbs, but none of the switches are labelled. You can turn the switches on and off as many times as you want, but you can only enter the room one time to observe the light bulbs. How can you figure out which switch corresponds to which light bulb?\n\n**My thought process:**\n\n1. **Initial thoughts:** This problem seems impossible at first, since we can only enter the room once and there are 3! = 6 possible combinations of switches and light bulbs.\n2. **Identify the key constraint:** The key constraint is that we can only enter the room once. This means we need to gather as much information as possible from a single observation.\n3. **Think about the possible states:** There are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the light bulbs (each bulb can be on or off). We need to find a way to map these states to the switches.\n4. **Find a pattern:** Let's think about what happens if we toggle a switch. If we toggle a switch, the corresponding light bulb will change state (on → off or off → on). This means that if we toggle two switches, the corresponding light bulbs will also change state.\n5. **Create a plan:** Here's a possible plan:\n\t* Turn switch 1 to ON for 5 minutes.\n\t* Turn switch 1 to OFF and turn switch 2 to ON.\n\t* Turn switch 2 to OFF and turn switch 3 to ON.\n\t* Enter the room and observe the light bulbs.\n6. **Analyze the observation:** Let's say we observe the following states:\n\t* Light bulb 1: ON\n\t* Light bulb 2: OFF\n\t* Light bulb 3: WARM (but off)\n\nFrom this observation, we can deduce the following:\n\n\t* Light bulb 1 was turned on for 5 minutes, so it's corresponding switch is switch 1.\n\t* Light bulb 2 was never turned on, so its corresponding switch is switch 2.\n\t* Light bulb 3 was turned on briefly, so its corresponding switch is switch 3.\n\n**Solution:** We've successfully mapped the switches to the light bulbs! 🎉\n\nThis puzzle requires a combination of creative thinking, pattern recognition, and analytical skills.

You're combining two separate entities (the ramen packets) into one, and the resulting mixture will have a combined volume of 1100ml. This is like creating a new commit that combines the changes from both branches.\n\nHowever, when you're cooking ramen, you don't need to combine the entire volume of water from each packet. You only need to add enough water to create a harmonious balance of flavors and texture. This is like doing a `rebase` operation. You're taking the changes from one branch (the new ramen packet) and applying them on top of the existing branch (the pot of water), without creating a new, combined entity.\n\nIn Git, `rebase` is like rewriting the commit history, whereas `merge` is like creating a new commit that combines the changes. When you `rebase`, you're essentially replaying the commits from one branch onto another, which can result in a cleaner, linear commit history.\n\nIn the case of cooking ramen, adding too much water can lead to a diluted flavor and an unbalanced texture. Similarly, in Git, using `merge` when you should be using `rebase` can lead to a cluttered commit history and unnecessary merge commits.\n\nSo, to summarize, the reason you shouldn't add 550ml of water for each ramen packet is that it's like doing a `merge` when you should be doing a `rebase`. You want to combine the flavors and textures in a harmonious way, just like you want to combine the changes in your codebase in a clean and efficient manner. 😊","Another great question! 🤔\n\nWhen cooking ramen, the amount of water that evaporates during cooking can affect the final texture and flavor of the dish. Here are some factors that can influence water evaporation:\n\n1. **Heat**: Higher heat can cause water to evaporate faster, leading to a more concentrated broth. Conversely, lower heat can result in slower evaporation and a more diluted broth.\n2. **Pot material**: The material of the pot can affect heat conduction and evaporation rates. For example, a pot made of a good heat conductor like copper or aluminum can cause water to evaporate faster than a pot made of a poor heat conductor like stainless steel or ceramic.\n3. **Pot size and shape**: A larger pot with a wider surface area can lead to faster evaporation, while a smaller pot with a narrower surface area can result in slower evaporation.\n4. **Lid usage**: Covering the pot with a lid can reduce evaporation by trapping steam and heat inside. However, if the lid is not tight-fitting, steam can escape, leading to increased evaporation.\n5. **Stirring and agitation**: Frequent stirring or agitation can increase evaporation by introducing more water molecules to the surface, where they can evaporate more easily.\n6. **Initial water temperature**: If the initial water temperature is higher, evaporation will occur faster. Conversely, if the initial water temperature is lower, evaporation will occur slower.\n7. **Humidity**: Cooking in a humid environment can reduce evaporation, as the air is already saturated with water vapor. In contrast, cooking in a dry environment can increase evaporation.\n8. **Altitude**: Cooking at high altitudes can lead to faster evaporation due to lower air pressure, which reduces the boiling point of water.\n\nThese factors can interact with each other in complex ways, making it important to adjust cooking techniques and ingredient ratios accordingly to achieve the desired texture and flavor.\n\nNow, if we were to draw an analogy with Git, these factors could be seen as influencing the \"evaporation\" of changes in the codebase. For example, the \"heat\" of frequent commits and merges can lead to a more complex and concentrated codebase, while the \"pot material\" of the development environment (e.g., IDE, tools, and workflows) can affect the speed and efficiency of coding. The \"lid usage\" of code reviews and testing can help trap errors and bugs, reducing the \"evaporation\" of mistakes into the codebase.

It's a classic example of an optimal stopping problem.\n\nThe optimal strategy for this problem is to use a \"37% rule\". Here's how it works:\n\n1. The first 37 employees (approximately 37% of the total) open cabinets at random, but don't stop at their own number. They just observe the numbers and move on.\n2. The 38th employee (and all subsequent employees) will stop at the first cabinet that contains a number that is lower than the lowest number seen so far by the previous 37 employees.\n\nThis strategy gives the highest probability of finding the correct cabinet for each employee.\n\nTo understand why this strategy works, let's analyze the problem:\n\n* If an employee opens a cabinet and finds their own number, they're done.\n* If they don't find their own number, they can eliminate that cabinet from the search space.\n* The first 37 employees are essentially \"exploring\" the search space, gathering information about the distribution of numbers in the cabinets.\n* By the time the 38th employee starts searching, they have a good idea of the distribution of numbers and can make an informed decision about when to stop.\n\nUsing this strategy, the probability of finding the correct cabinet for each employee is approximately 0.371, which is the highest possible probability.\n\nNote that this strategy is not intuitive, and it's counterintuitive that the first 37 employees don't stop at their own number. However, this strategy has been proven to be optimal through mathematical analysis and simulations.","When the number of employees is 30 and each employee can open 15 cabinets, the optimal strategy is not exactly the same as the 37% rule. However, the underlying principle of exploring the search space and using the gathered information to make an informed decision still applies.\n\nIn this case, the optimal strategy is to use a \"1\/3 rule\". Here's how it works:\n\n1. The first 10 employees (approximately 1\/3 of the total) open 15 cabinets each, but don't stop at their own number. They just observe the numbers and move on.\n2. The 11th employee (and all subsequent employees) will stop at the first cabinet that contains a number that is lower than the lowest number seen so far by the previous 10 employees.\n\nThis strategy gives the highest probability of finding the correct cabinet for each employee.\n\nThe 1\/3 rule is a generalization of the 37% rule, and it's applicable when the number of employees and the number of cabinets that can be opened are smaller. The key idea is to balance the exploration phase (where employees gather information about the search space) with the exploitation phase (where employees use that information to make an informed decision).\n\nIn this case, the probability of finding the correct cabinet for each employee using the 1\/3 rule is approximately 0.342, which is still a relatively high probability.\n\nNote that as the number of employees and the number of cabinets that can be opened decrease, the optimal strategy becomes more complex, and the probability of finding the correct cabinet also decreases. However, the 1\/3 rule provides a good approximation of the optimal strategy in this scenario."],"references":["이 문제는 원순열(순환이 이루어지는 순열)을 이용해서 풀 수 있다. 해당 전략을 이용하면 (1\/2)^100의 확률을 약 0.31까지 올릴 수 있다.","유효하다."]}

Here's a rough outline for \"The Heroine Who Came from the Future\":\n\n**Story Premise:**\n\nIn the year 2050, humanity has reached an unprecedented level of technological advancement. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and the world is on the brink of collapse due to environmental disasters, wars over resources, and social unrest. Amidst the chaos, a brilliant scientist, Dr. Sophia Patel, discovers a way to send a person back in time to prevent the catastrophic events from occurring.\n\nThe chosen hero is none other than her own daughter, Maya, a 17-year-old high school student who has always felt like an outsider. Maya is sent back to the year 2023, with the mission to alter the course of history and create a better future.\n\n**Main Plot:**\n\nMaya finds herself in the past, struggling to adjust to a world without advanced technology and social media. She must navigate high school life, make new friends, and uncover the events that led to the downfall of humanity. As she tries to prevent the disasters, she realizes that changing the past is not as simple as she thought. Every action has unintended consequences, and Maya must confront the moral dilemmas of altering the timeline.\n\n**Subplots:**\n\n1. **Romance:** Maya develops feelings for a classmate, Taro, who becomes her ally in her mission. However, their relationship is complicated by the fact that Taro's family is involved in the events that led to the catastrophic future.\n2. **Rivalry:** A rival time traveler, sent by a rival organization, appears in the past, trying to sabotage Maya's mission and ensure the catastrophic future remains intact.\n3. **Personal growth:** Maya's experiences in the past help her discover her own strengths and weaknesses, and she must come to terms with her new identity as a time traveler.\n\n**Avoiding Clichés:**\n\nTo avoid making the story too predictable, I'll focus on the following:\n\n1. **Unconventional protagonist:** Maya is not a typical hero. She's a teenager, not a skilled warrior or scientist. Her inexperience and naivety make her relatable and human.\n2. **Morally ambiguous choices:** Maya's actions will have unintended consequences, and she'll face difficult decisions that challenge her values and morals.\n3. **Non-linear storytelling:** The story will jump back and forth between the past and the future, revealing clues and hints about the catastrophic events and Maya's mission.\n4. **Diverse cast:** The characters will come from different backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses, adding depth and richness to the story.\n5. **Scientific accuracy:** While the time travel concept is fictional, I'll strive to incorporate real scientific theories and concepts to make the story more believable and engaging.\n6. **Character development:** Maya's growth and relationships will be the heart of the story, rather than just the plot twists and action scenes.\n\nBy focusing on these elements, I hope to create a unique and engaging story that will captivate readers and keep them invested in Maya's journey. 📚💫","Here's a possible opening to \"The Heroine Who Came from the Future\":\n\n**Prologue: 2050**\n\nDr. Sophia Patel stared at the sleek, silver pod in front of her, her heart racing with excitement and trepidation.

The pod, codenamed \"Chrono,\" was the key to changing the course of human history.\n\n\"Are you sure you're ready for this, Maya?\" Sophia asked, turning to her 17-year-old daughter, who stood beside her, her eyes fixed on the pod.\n\nMaya nodded, her ponytail bobbing with determination. \"I was born for this, Mom. I'm the only one who can do this.\"\n\nSophia's eyes misted as she gazed at her daughter. She had always known that Maya was special, but she had never imagined that her child would be the one to save humanity.\n\nWith a deep breath, Sophia initiated the countdown sequence. The pod's hatch opened, and Maya stepped inside. Sophia's heart ached as she watched her daughter disappear into the sleek, silver interior.\n\n\"Goodbye, Maya,\" Sophia whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the machinery. \"Change the world.\"\n\n**Chapter 1: 2023**\n\nMaya's eyes fluttered open, and she was greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling. She sat up, disoriented, and looked around. She was in a high school classroom, surrounded by students chatting and laughing. The teacher, a middle-aged woman with a kind smile, approached her.\n\n\"Welcome back, Maya. You must have dozed off during the lesson. Are you feeling okay?\"\n\nMaya's mind reeled as she tried to process what was happening. She was supposed to be in 2050, not 2023. And who was this woman calling her Maya?\n\n\"I...I think so,\" Maya stammered, trying to play along.\n\nThe teacher handed her a notebook and pen. \"You can catch up on the lesson later. Why don't you take a few minutes to collect yourself?\"\n\nMaya nodded, still dazed. As she began to scribble in the notebook, she noticed the date on the top of the page: March 15, 2023.\n\nHer heart skipped a beat. She had done it. She had traveled back in time.\n\nBut as she looked around the classroom, Maya realized that she was not alone. There were people watching her, people who seemed to know more about her than she knew about herself.\n\nAnd then, there was the boy with piercing blue eyes, who smiled at her from across the room...\n\n(To be continued!)"],"references":[null,null]}

As a space traveler who has left Earth behind, I'd like to approach this journal entry by reflecting on the nostalgia and longing I feel for the planet I once called home. Here's a possible approach:\n\n**Title:** \"Echoes of Terra\"\n\n**Date:** Galactic Cycle 2345, Sector 9, Planet Kepler-62f\n\n**Entry:**\n\nAs I gaze out the viewport of my spacecraft, the stars twinkling like diamonds against the inky blackness, my mind wanders back to the planet I left behind. Earth, my home, my haven. The memories of its vibrant blue skies, the warmth of its sun on my skin, and the gentle rustle of its breeze through the trees all feel like a distant dream now.\n\nI miss the smell of freshly cut grass, the taste of a ripe, juicy apple, and the sound of birds singing in the morning. I miss the feeling of walking on solid ground, of feeling the weight of gravity pulling me down. I even miss the imperfections – the pollution, the conflicts, the chaos. It was all so... human.\n\nI think about the people I left behind, my friends and family, and the memories we shared. I wonder if they're thinking of me, too, if they're looking up at the same stars and wondering if I'm out here, somewhere, thinking of them.\n\nThe vastness of space is overwhelming, and sometimes it feels like I'm just a tiny, insignificant speck in an endless expanse. But in those moments, I close my eyes and remember the Earth. I remember the way the sunlight danced through the clouds, the way the ocean waves crashed against the shore, and the way the mountains towered above the landscape.\n\nI'm grateful for the technology that allows me to record my thoughts and emotions, to preserve the memories of my time on Earth. It's a bittersweet comfort, knowing that even as I explore the unknown, a part of me will always remain tied to that small, blue planet.\n\n**Sketch:**\n\n[Insert a sketch of the Earth from space, with the curvature of the planet visible, and a small, faint outline of a human figure in the foreground, looking back at the planet.]\n\n**Audio Log:**\n\n[Insert a short audio clip of the sound of waves crashing against the shore, or a gentle breeze rustling through trees, to evoke a sense of nostalgia and longing.]\n\nThis approach allows me to express my emotions and thoughts in a way that's both personal and introspective, while also incorporating sensory details to bring the memories to life. The title \"Echoes of Terra\" captures the idea of the Earth's presence still resonating within me, even as I venture further into the unknown.","What a great question! As a space traveler writing a journal, I'd say that there are several challenges that make it more difficult than writing a journal on Earth:\n\n1. **Isolation and loneliness**: As a space traveler, I'm often alone or with a small crew, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. This can make it harder to find the motivation to write, as there's no one to share my thoughts with or get feedback from.\n2. **Unfamiliar environment**: The environment in space is vastly different from what I'm used to on Earth. The lack of gravity, the confined spaces, and the constant noise of machinery can be overwhelming and make it difficult to focus on writing.\n3. **Limited resources**: In space, resources are limited, and writing materials might be scarce. I might not have access to paper, pens, or even a reliable power source to charge my writing device.\n4. **Time dilation**: Due to the effects of relativity, time can appear to pass differently in space. This can make it challenging to keep track of time, which can affect my writing schedule and consistency.\n5. **Disconnection from nature**: As a space traveler, I'm disconnected from the natural world, which can make it harder to find inspiration and connection to the world around me. The lack of natural light, fresh air, and the sounds of nature can be stifling to my creativity.\n6. **Psychological factors**: The psychological effects of being in space for extended periods can be significant. The isolation, confinement, and uncertainty can lead to anxiety, depression, or even space madness. This can make it difficult to maintain a consistent writing routine or even find the motivation to write.\n7. **Communication delay**: If I'm writing in a journal, I might not be able to share my thoughts with others in real-time. The delay in communication can make it feel like I'm writing into a void, which can be demotivating.\n8. **Preservation of memories**: As a space traveler, I might not have the luxury of keeping physical mementos or memorabilia. My journal becomes an even more precious record of my experiences, and the pressure to preserve my memories accurately can be overwhelming.\n9. **The burden of representation**: As one of the few humans in space, I might feel a sense of responsibility to represent humanity or document the experience for future generations. This can add pressure to my writing, making it harder to express myself freely.\n10. **The unknown**: Space is full of unknowns, and the uncertainty of my situation can be unsettling.

Let's imagine how Karl Marx, the author of Das Kapital, would view the current economic phenomenon of Bitcoin's surge and analyze modern society's problems from his perspective.\n\n**The fetishism of commodities**\n\nMarx would likely view Bitcoin as a prime example of the fetishism of commodities, where a virtual good is assigned an arbitrary value based on social relations and market forces, rather than its inherent usefulness or labor value. He would argue that the value of Bitcoin is not derived from its utility or the labor that goes into creating it, but rather from the social relations and power dynamics that govern the market.\n\nIn his view, the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin's value would be seen as a manifestation of the irrationality of the capitalist system, where the pursuit of profit and wealth creation becomes an end in itself, detached from the real needs and well-being of society. The fact that Bitcoin's value is largely driven by speculation and hype, rather than any tangible economic fundamentals, would be seen as a classic example of the fetishism of commodities.\n\n**The concentration of wealth and power**\n\nMarx would likely argue that the rise of Bitcoin has further exacerbated the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals and institutions. The fact that a small group of early adopters and large investors hold a significant portion of the total Bitcoin supply would be seen as a manifestation of the inherent inequality and exploitation built into the capitalist system.\n\nHe would point out that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, often touted as a democratizing force, has actually led to a new form of centralization, where a small elite controls the majority of the network's wealth and influence. This concentration of power would be seen as a threat to the autonomy and agency of individuals, as well as a perpetuation of the existing social and economic hierarchies.\n\n**The alienation of labor**\n\nMarx would also argue that the rise of Bitcoin has led to a new form of alienation of labor, where individuals are no longer in control of their own labor and creativity. The fact that many people are now engaged in the speculative activity of buying and selling Bitcoin, rather than engaging in productive labor, would be seen as a form of alienation from their true human potential.\n\nHe would point out that the automation of labor through algorithms and machines, which is often touted as a benefit of the digital economy, has actually led to a loss of autonomy and control over one's own labor. The fact that individuals are now reduced to mere spectators, watching as their labor is exploited by machines and algorithms, would be seen as a fundamental contradiction of the capitalist system.\n\n**The crisis of capitalism**\n\nFinally, Marx would likely view the rise of Bitcoin as a symptom of a deeper crisis of capitalism, where the system is no longer able to provide for the basic needs of society. The fact that people are turning to speculative activities like Bitcoin as a means of survival, rather than engaging in productive labor, would be seen as a sign of a system in crisis.\n\nHe would argue that the pursuit of profit and wealth creation has become an end in itself, detached from the real needs and well-being of society. The fact that the majority of people are struggling to make ends meet, while a small elite accumulates wealth and power, would be seen as a fundamental contradiction of the capitalist system.\n\nIn conclusion, from Marx's perspective, the rise of Bitcoin would be seen as a manifestation of the inherent contradictions and flaws of the capitalist system, including the fetishism of commodities, the concentration of wealth and power, the alienation of labor, and the crisis of capitalism. He would argue that the only way to address these problems is through a fundamental transformation of the economic system, one that prioritizes the needs and well-being of society over the pursuit of profit and wealth creation.","Analyzing modern society's problems from Karl Marx's perspective can be challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. **Contextual differences**: Marx wrote in the 19th century, and his ideas were shaped by the industrial capitalism of his time. Modern society has undergone significant changes, such as the rise of service-oriented economies, globalization, and the digital revolution. Applying Marx's ideas to contemporary issues requires careful consideration of these contextual differences.\n2. **Complexity of modern capitalism**: Modern capitalism is more complex and nuanced than the industrial capitalism Marx critiqued. The rise of finance capitalism, neoliberalism, and the gig economy, among other factors, have created a more intricate system that may not fit neatly into Marx's original framework.\n3. **New forms of exploitation**: Marx focused on the exploitation of labor in the industrial setting. However, modern society has given rise to new forms of exploitation, such as the exploitation of data, attention, and emotional labor, which may not be directly addressed in Marx's work.\n4. **Globalization and international relations**: Marx's work primarily focused on the national economy and the relationships between capital and labor within a single country. Modern society is characterized by globalization, international trade, and complex global supply chains, which require a more nuanced understanding of international relations and the global economy.\n5. **Technological advancements**: The rapid pace of technological change has transformed the nature of work, leisure, and social relations. Marx's ideas on the role of technology in society may need to be reinterpreted or updated to account for the impact of automation, artificial intelligence, and other modern technologies.\n6. **Diverse forms of oppression**: Marx's primary focus was on class struggle and the exploitation of the working class. However, modern society recognizes a broader range of oppressions, including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism, among others. Integrating these perspectives into a Marxist analysis can be challenging.\n7. **Criticisms and revisions of Marx's ideas**: Marx's work has been subject to various criticisms and revisions over the years. Some of these critiques, such as those from feminist, postcolonial, or poststructuralist perspectives, may require a reevaluation of Marx's ideas and their application to modern society.\n8. **The role of the state**: Marx's work often assumed a relatively weak state or a state that served the interests of the ruling class. However, modern states play a more complex role, with some states actively intervening in the economy and others adopting more neoliberal policies.\n9. **The rise of new social movements**: Modern society has seen the emergence of new social movements, such as environmentalism, LGBTQ+ rights, and anti-racism movements, which may not fit neatly into Marx's framework. Integrating these movements into a Marxist analysis requires a nuanced understanding of their relationships with class struggle and capitalist systems.\n10. **The need for interdisciplinary approaches**: Analyzing modern society's problems from a Marxist perspective often requires an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from sociology, economics, political science, philosophy, and other fields. This can be a challenging task, as it demands a deep understanding of multiple disciplines and their relationships.\n\nBy acknowledging these challenges, researchers and scholars can engage in a more nuanced and informed analysis of modern society's problems from a Marxist perspective, taking into account the complexities and changes that have occurred since Marx's time."],"references":[null,null]}

It's a way to analyze the performance of an algorithm, helping us understand how it will scale as the input size increases.\n\nThere are several ways to measure time complexity, but the most common ones are:\n\n1. **Big O notation**: This is an upper bound on the time complexity, expressed as a function of the input size (usually denoted as 'n'). For example, O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), etc.\n2. **Ω notation**: This is a lower bound on the time complexity, also expressed as a function of the input size.\n3. **Θ notation**: This is a tight bound on the time complexity, which is both an upper and lower bound.\n\nTo calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, you can:\n\n1. Count the number of operations (e.g., loops, recursive calls, array accesses) and express it as a function of the input size.\n2. Analyze the algorithm's structure and identify the dominant operation(s) that contribute most to the time complexity.\n3. Use mathematical techniques, such as summation, recursion, or amortized analysis, to simplify the expression and arrive at a Big O, Ω, or Θ notation.\n\n**Optimization Examples**\n\nHere are some examples of algorithms that have been optimized to reduce their time complexity:\n\n1. **Binary Search**: The original algorithm had a time complexity of O(n), but by using a divide-and-conquer approach, the optimized algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n).\n2. **Merge Sort**: The original algorithm had a time complexity of O(n^2), but by using a divide-and-conquer approach and optimizing the merge step, the optimized algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n).\n3. **Hash Table Lookup**: The original algorithm had a time complexity of O(n), but by using a hash function and a collision resolution strategy, the optimized algorithm has an average time complexity of O(1).\n\n**Example: Optimizing Bubble Sort**\n\nBubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2). Here's an optimized version that reduces the time complexity to O(n) in the best case:\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    swapped = True\n    while swapped:\n        swapped = False\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:\n                arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]\n                swapped = True\n        n -= 1\n    return arr\n```\nIn this optimized version, we added a `swapped` flag to track whether any swaps were made in the inner loop. If no swaps were made, the array is already sorted, and we can exit the algorithm early. This optimization reduces the time complexity to O(n) in the best case, when the input array is already sorted.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how algorithms can be optimized to reduce their time complexity. By analyzing the algorithm's structure and identifying opportunities for improvement, we can create more efficient algorithms that scale better with large inputs. 💻","😊\n\n**Space Complexity**\n\nSpace complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, usually expressed as a function of the input size. It's a way to analyze the memory usage of an algorithm, helping us understand how it will scale as the input size increases.\n\nSpace complexity is often denoted using the same notations as time complexity: O, Ω, and Θ. However, instead of measuring the number of operations, we measure the amount of memory used.\n\n**Key differences between Time and Space Complexity**\n\n1. **Focus**: Time complexity focuses on the number of operations, while space complexity focuses on the amount of memory used.\n2. **Measurement**: Time complexity is usually measured in terms of the number of operations (e.g., loops, recursive calls), while space complexity is measured in terms of the amount of memory used (e.g., bytes, words).\n3. **Impact**: Time complexity affects the running time of the algorithm, while space complexity affects the memory usage and can lead to issues like memory exhaustion or cache thrashing.\n\n**Examples of Space Complexity**\n\n1. **Array-based algorithms**: Algorithms that use arrays to store data, such as sorting algorithms, have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array.\n2. **Recursive algorithms**: Recursive algorithms can have a high space complexity due to the recursive function calls, which can lead to a large call stack.\n3. **Data structures**: Data structures like graphs, trees, and hash tables can have a high space complexity due to the amount of memory required to store the data.\n\n**Optimizing Space Complexity**\n\nOptimizing space complexity is crucial in situations where memory is limited, such as:\n\n1. **Embedded systems**: Devices with limited memory, like microcontrollers or embedded systems, require algorithms with low space complexity.\n2. **Mobile devices**: Mobile devices have limited memory, and algorithms with high space complexity can lead to performance issues.\n3. **Distributed systems**: Distributed systems, like cloud computing or cluster computing, require algorithms with low space complexity to minimize memory usage across nodes.\n\nTo optimize space complexity, you can:\n\n1. **Use efficient data structures**: Choose data structures that use less memory, such as arrays instead of linked lists.\n2. **Minimize memory allocations**: Reduce the number of memory allocations and deallocations, which can lead to memory fragmentation.\n3. **Use compression**: Compress data to reduce the amount of memory used.\n\nBy considering both time and space complexity, you can design algorithms that are efficient in terms of both running time and memory usage. 💻"],"references":[null,null]}

It is defined as:\n\nf(x) = max(0, x)\n\nIn other words, ReLU takes the input x and outputs 0 if x is negative, and x if x is positive. This means that ReLU only allows positive values to pass through, while negative values are set to 0.\n\nReLU is widely used in deep learning because of its simplicity and computational efficiency. It is also non-linear, which allows the model to learn more complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n\nHere are some benefits of using ReLU:\n\n* **Fast computation**: ReLU is very fast to compute, as it only requires a simple thresholding operation.\n* **Non-linearity**: ReLU is a non-linear function, which allows the model to learn more complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n* **Sparsity**: ReLU can help to introduce sparsity in the model, as negative values are set to 0.\n\nHowever, ReLU also has some limitations:\n\n* **Dead neurons**: During training, some neurons may output 0 for all inputs, which can lead to \"dead\" neurons that do not contribute to the model's predictions.\n* **Non-differentiable**: ReLU is not differentiable at x=0, which can make optimization more difficult.\n\nThere are several other activation functions that are similar to ReLU, including:\n\n* **Leaky ReLU**: f(x) = max(0.01x, x) - This is a variation of ReLU that allows a small fraction of the input to pass through, even if it's negative.\n* **Swish**: f(x) = x \\* g(x) - This is a self-gated activation function that can be seen as a smooth version of ReLU.\n* **Sigmoid**: f(x) = 1 \/ (1 + exp(-x)) - This is a non-linear activation function that outputs a value between 0 and 1.\n* **Tanh**: f(x) = 2 \/ (1 + exp(-2x)) - 1 - This is a non-linear activation function that outputs a value between -1 and 1.\n* **Softmax**: f(x) = exp(x) \/ sum(exp(x)) - This is typically used as the output layer activation function in classification problems, as it outputs a probability distribution over all classes.\n* **GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)**: f(x) = x \\* Φ(x) - This is a non-linear activation function that is similar to ReLU, but with a smoother curve.\n* **SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Unit)**: f(x) = λ \\* (x if x > 0 else α \\* (exp(x) - 1)) - This is a self-normalizing activation function that can help to stabilize the training process.\n\nEach of these activation functions has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific problem and model architecture."],"references":[null,null]}

The client sends a request to the server with updated data, and the server updates only the specified fields of the resource.\n* **Example:** A user updates only their email address on a website, and the server updates only the email address field of the user's profile.\n\nIn HTTP\/2, these methods remain the same, but the protocol introduces several improvements, such as:\n\n* Multiplexing: Multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection, improving performance.\n* Header compression: Header data is compressed, reducing overhead.\n* Binary framing: Data is framed in a binary format, making it more efficient to parse and process.\n\nThese improvements enable faster and more efficient communication between clients and servers, making HTTP\/2 a more performant and scalable protocol than HTTP\/1.1.","😊\n\n`PUT` and `PATCH` are both used to update resources on a server, but they have different semantics and use cases.\n\n**PUT**\n\n* **Replace the entire resource**: When you send a `PUT` request, you're essentially replacing the entire resource with a new version. The request body should contain the entire resource, and the server will overwrite the existing resource with the new one.\n* **Idempotent**: `PUT` is an idempotent method, meaning that making the same request multiple times will have the same effect as making it once. This is because the request is replacing the entire resource, so repeating the request won't change the outcome.\n* **Example**: Updating a user's entire profile information, including name, email, and address.\n\n**PATCH**\n\n* **Partial update**: When you send a `PATCH` request, you're updating only specific fields of a resource. The request body should contain only the changes, and the server will apply those changes to the existing resource.\n* **Non-idempotent**: `PATCH` is a non-idempotent method, meaning that making the same request multiple times can have different effects. This is because the request is updating only specific fields, and repeating the request can lead to unintended changes.\n* **Example**: Updating only a user's email address, leaving the rest of the profile information unchanged.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider the following example:\n\nSuppose you have a user resource with the following attributes: `name`, `email`, and `address`. You want to update only the `email` attribute.\n\n**PUT**:\n\n* Request body: `{\"name\": \"John\", \"email\": \"new_email@example.com\", \"address\": \"123 Main St\"}`\n* Server response: The entire user resource is replaced with the new data, including the updated `email` attribute.\n\n**PATCH**:\n\n* Request body: `{\"email\": \"new_email@example.com\"}`\n* Server response: Only the `email` attribute is updated, leaving the `name` and `address` attributes unchanged.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Use `PUT` when you need to replace the entire resource with a new version.\n* Use `PATCH` when you need to update only specific fields of a resource.\n\nBy using the correct method, you can ensure that your API is more efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain. 💻"],"references":["GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT 중 5개를 설명","PUT은 전체를 업데이트하는 반면, PATCH는 일부를 업데이트한다."]}

We create an empty dictionary `char_count` to store the count of each character in the input list.\n2. We iterate through the input list and update the count of each character in the dictionary. If a character is already in the dictionary, we increment its count by 1. If it's not in the dictionary, we add it with a count of 1.\n3. We iterate through the input list again and check if the count of each character is 1. If we find a character with a count of 1, we return it as the first unique character.\n4. If no unique character is found, we return `None`.\n\nHere are some test cases to demonstrate the function:\n```\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd']))  # Output: 'b'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'c'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']))  # Output: 'a'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c']))  # Output: None\n```\nNote that this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we iterate through the list twice. If the input list is very large, a more efficient solution may be needed.","Here are some ways to increase the difficulty of the problem:\n\n1. **Case Insensitivity**: Make the function case-insensitive, so that 'A' and 'a' are considered the same character.\n2. **Non-ASCII Characters**: Include non-ASCII characters in the input list, such as accented letters, emojis, or characters from non-Latin scripts.\n3. **Large Input List**: Increase the size of the input list to thousands or millions of characters, making the function's performance a concern.\n4. **Multiple Unique Characters**: Instead of returning the first unique character, return all unique characters in the list.\n5. **Order of Appearance**: Return the unique characters in the order of their first appearance in the list.\n6. **Streamed Input**: Instead of receiving the entire list at once, receive the characters one by one, and return the first unique character as soon as it is found.\n7. **Memory Constraints**: Impose a memory limit on the function, so that it cannot use more than a certain amount of memory to solve the problem.\n8. **Time Complexity**: Require the function to have a specific time complexity, such as O(n) or O(log n), making the solution more challenging.\n9. **Error Handling**: Add error handling to the function, so that it can handle invalid input, such as an empty list or a list containing non-string elements.\n10. **Multithreading**: Make the function multithreaded, so that it can take advantage of multiple CPU cores to process the input list in parallel.\n\nHere's an example of how the problem could be modified to include some of these challenges:\n\n**Modified Problem**:\n\nWrite a function `find_unique_characters` that takes a stream of characters as input and returns a list of all unique characters in the order of their first appearance. The function should be case-insensitive and should handle non-ASCII characters. The input stream may contain up to 1 million characters, and the function should use no more than 1MB of memory.

Here are some reasons why:\n\n**Lack of emphasis on focus and attention**: Modern education often prioritizes multitasking, quick answers, and instant gratification, which can lead to a culture of distraction and superficial learning. Students are not encouraged to focus on a single task for an extended period, making it difficult for them to develop their ability to concentrate.\n\n**Overreliance on technology**: While technology has many benefits, it can also be a significant distraction. Students are often encouraged to use digital tools and social media, which can lead to a constant stream of notifications, emails, and messages, making it challenging to focus on a single task.\n\n**Fragmented learning**: The education system often breaks down learning into smaller, manageable chunks, which can lead to a lack of depth and understanding. Students may not have the opportunity to engage in prolonged, in-depth learning experiences that foster deep work skills.\n\n**Pressure to perform**: The emphasis on standardized testing, grades, and competition can create a high-stress environment that discourages deep work. Students may feel pressured to produce quick results rather than taking the time to engage in thoughtful, reflective learning.\n\n**Lack of autonomy and agency**: Students are often not given the freedom to choose their own topics or projects, which can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement. When students are not invested in their work, they are less likely to develop deep work skills.\n\n**Inadequate feedback and guidance**: Teachers may not provide adequate feedback and guidance to help students develop their deep work skills. Students may not receive constructive criticism on their work, making it difficult for them to identify areas for improvement.\n\n**Distractions in the classroom**: Classrooms can be distracting environments, with peers, social media, and other stimuli competing for students' attention. This can make it challenging for students to focus and develop their deep work skills.\n\n**Homework and busywork**: Excessive homework and busywork can lead to a culture of superficial learning, where students are more focused on completing tasks quickly rather than engaging in meaningful, in-depth learning.\n\nTo support the development of deep work skills, educators and policymakers can:\n\n* Encourage students to engage in prolonged, in-depth learning experiences\n* Provide opportunities for students to work on self-directed projects and topics of interest\n* Foster a culture of focus and attention, with minimal distractions\n* Offer constructive feedback and guidance to help students improve their work\n* Emphasize the value of deep work and its benefits in achieving academic and professional success\n\nBy addressing these challenges, we can create an education system that supports the development of deep work skills, enabling students to thrive in an increasingly complex and competitive world."],"references":["B",null]}

This is probably the most common meaning of the word, and it's used in everyday conversations, recipes, and even in brand names like \"사과마트\" (Apple Mart).\n\n**2. 사과 (Apology)**\n\nIn this sense, \"사과\" means \"apology\" or \"to apologize.\" When someone says \"저는 사과합니다\" (jeo-neun sa-gwa-ham-ni-da), it means \"I apologize\" or \"I'm sorry.\" This meaning is often used in formal or polite settings, such as in business, politics, or when expressing remorse for a mistake.\n\nThese two meanings are quite different, but both are commonly used in Korean language and culture. It's interesting to note that the word \"사과\" has multiple meanings, and the context usually helps disambiguate which meaning is intended.","😊\n\nIn linguistics, there are two related but distinct concepts: homophones (동음이의어) and polysemes (다의어). Both refer to words that share similarities, but they differ in their relationships and meanings.\n\n**Homophones (동음이의어)**\n\nHomophones are words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings and, often, different spellings. In other words, they are words that sound the same when spoken, but have distinct meanings and uses.\n\nExamples:\n\n* bank (financial institution) and bank (slope or incline)\n* to (preposition) and two (number) and too (also)\n* knight (medieval warrior) and night (time of day)\n\n**Polysemes (다의어)**\n\nPolysemes, on the other hand, are words that have multiple related meanings, often with a shared core meaning or concept. Polysemes are words that have evolved to have different but connected senses, often through metaphorical extension or semantic broadening.\n\nExamples:\n\n* head (body part) and head (leader or chief)\n* heart (organ) and heart (emotional center)\n* spring (season) and spring (coiled metal object that stores energy)\n\nKey differences:\n\n* Homophones have different meanings and often different spellings, while polysemes have related meanings and usually the same spelling.\n* Homophones are often unrelated in meaning, while polysemes are connected through a shared core concept or metaphor.\n\nIn the case of the Korean word \"사과\" (sa-gwa), it is an example of polysemy, as it has two related meanings (apple and apology) that are connected through a shared concept of \"something being offered or given\" (an apple as a gift, or an apology as an offering of regret).\n\nI hope this helps clarify the difference between homophones and polysemes! 😊"],"references":["아래 뜻 중 두 가지 이상 언급했으면 정답으로 인정.\n1. 자기의 잘못을 인정하고 용서를 빎. 2.
