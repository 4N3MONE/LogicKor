However, its ambiguity and subjectivity can lead to controversies and debates. Establishing a universally accepted definition of justice that resonates with the majority of society is a challenging task. Here are some possible approaches to consider:\n\n1. **Philosophical inquiry**: Engage in philosophical discussions and debates to explore the concept of justice from various perspectives, such as distributive justice, retributive justice, and restorative justice. This can help identify common themes and principles that underlie different conceptions of justice.\n2. **Cross-cultural analysis**: Study the concept of justice across different cultures, historical periods, and legal systems to identify commonalities and differences. This can provide insights into the universal aspects of justice that transcend cultural and temporal boundaries.\n3. **Empirical research**: Conduct empirical studies to understand how people from diverse backgrounds perceive and experience justice. This can involve surveys, interviews, and experiments to gather data on what people consider just or unjust in various contexts.\n4. **Deliberative democracy**: Organize deliberative forums, such as citizen juries or public deliberations, where people from diverse backgrounds engage in informed discussions and debates about justice. This can help identify areas of consensus and build a shared understanding of justice.\n5. **Legal and political theory**: Analyze legal and political theories, such as liberalism, utilitarianism, and egalitarianism, to identify their underlying conceptions of justice. This can provide a framework for understanding the normative principles that underpin different legal systems.\n6. **International human rights**: Draw on international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to identify universally accepted principles of justice. These principles can serve as a foundation for a shared understanding of justice across cultures and legal systems.\n7. **Contextualization**: Recognize that justice is context-dependent and that its meaning can vary depending on the specific circumstances. This approach acknowledges that what is considered just in one context may not be in another, and that justice must be understood within the specific cultural, historical, and social context in which it is applied.\n8. **Pragmatic approach**: Focus on the practical implications of justice, such as fairness, equality, and protection of individual rights, rather than trying to define justice in abstract terms. This approach can help build a shared understanding of justice through its tangible effects on people's lives.\n9. **Education and public awareness**: Promote education and public awareness about the concept of justice, its importance, and its various interpretations. This can foster a more informed and nuanced understanding of justice among the general public.\n10. **Ongoing dialogue and revision**: Recognize that the concept of justice is not fixed and that it evolves over time. Encourage ongoing dialogue and revision of our understanding of justice, acknowledging that it is a dynamic and multifaceted concept that requires continuous reflection and refinement.\n\nBy considering these approaches, we can work towards establishing a more comprehensive and inclusive understanding of justice that resonates with the majority of society.","Here is a summary of the previous response in three English sentences:\n\nTo establish a universally accepted definition of justice, we can engage in philosophical inquiry, cross-cultural analysis, and empirical research to identify common themes and principles.

Each switch corresponds to one of the light bulbs, but none of the switches are labelled. You can turn the switches on and off as many times as you want, but you can only enter the room one time to observe the light bulbs. How can you figure out which switch corresponds to which light bulb?\n\n**My thought process:**\n\n1. **Initial thoughts:** This problem seems impossible at first, because we can't label the switches and we can only enter the room once. But let's think about what we can do: we can turn the switches on and off, and we can observe the light bulbs.\n2. **Identify the key constraint:** The key constraint is that we can only enter the room once. This means we need to gather as much information as possible from a single observation.\n3. **Think about the possible states:** There are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the light bulbs: all off, all on, or some combination of on and off.\n4. **Design an experiment:** Let's design an experiment that will give us the most information. We can turn two switches on for 5 minutes, and then turn one of them off. Then, we enter the room and observe the light bulbs.\n5. **Analyze the possible outcomes:** There are several possible outcomes:\n\t* One light bulb is on, and it's hot (i.e., it was on for 5 minutes).\n\t* One light bulb is on, and it's cold (i.e., it was just turned on).\n\t* One light bulb is off, and it's hot.\n\t* One light bulb is off, and it's cold.\n\t* All light bulbs are off.\n6. **Deduce the switch-light bulb connections:** Based on the outcome, we can deduce the switch-light bulb connections. For example, if we see one light bulb that's on and hot, we know that switch corresponds to that light bulb. If we see one light bulb that's off and hot, we know that switch corresponds to that light bulb, and so on.\n7. **Check for consistency:** We need to make sure our deductions are consistent with the experiment we designed. If we find any inconsistencies, we need to revisit our analysis.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's say we turn switches A and B on for 5 minutes, and then turn off switch A. We enter the room and observe the light bulbs.\n\n* If we see one light bulb that's on and hot, it must correspond to switch B.\n* If we see one light bulb that's on and cold, it must correspond to switch C.\n* If we see one light bulb that's off and hot, it must correspond to switch A.\n* If we see one light bulb that's off and cold, it must correspond to switch C (if we didn't see a cold light bulb that's on).\n\nBy using this process, we can figure out which switch corresponds to which light bulb with a single observation. 💡"],"references":["B",null]}

Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Noodle absorption**: Ramen noodles are designed to absorb a significant amount of water during cooking. As they cook, they swell and absorb water, which helps to rehydrate the starches and make the noodles tender. If you use too much water, the noodles may become over-hydrated, leading to a mushy or soggy texture.\n2. **Water evaporation**: When you cook the noodles, some of the water will evaporate as steam, especially if you're cooking at high heat. This means that the actual amount of water left in the pot will be less than the initial amount you added.\n3. **Starch gelatinization**: Ramen noodles contain starches that gelatinize when they come into contact with hot water. This process helps to thicken the broth and create a creamy texture. If you use too much water, the starches may not gelatinize properly, resulting in a watery broth.\n4. **Broth concentration**: Ramen broth is typically designed to be concentrated, with a rich, savory flavor. If you use too much water, the broth may become diluted, losing its flavor and texture.\n\nBy using less water than the total package instructions suggest, you can achieve a better balance of noodle texture, broth consistency, and flavor. The recommended water amount on the package is often a general guideline, and you may need to adjust it based on your personal preference and the specific type of ramen you're cooking.\n\nIn your case, using 550ml of water for two packets of ramen is a reasonable amount, as it allows for the noodles to cook properly while still maintaining a flavorful broth. However, feel free to experiment with different water ratios to find your perfect balance! 🍜","🤔\n\nThe amount of water evaporation during cooking is influenced by several factors. Here are some of the key ones:\n\n1. **Heat intensity**: Higher heat leads to faster evaporation. If you're cooking at high heat, more water will evaporate quickly.\n2. **Cooking time**: The longer you cook, the more water will evaporate. This is because the water is exposed to heat for a longer period, allowing more molecules to escape as steam.\n3. **Pot material**: The material of your pot can affect evaporation rates. For example, pots made of copper or aluminum tend to heat up quickly and can lead to faster evaporation, while pots made of stainless steel or ceramic may heat up more slowly.\n4. **Pot size and shape**: A larger pot with a wider surface area can lead to faster evaporation, as there's more water exposed to the heat. A smaller pot with a narrower surface area may evaporate water more slowly.\n5. **Lid usage**: Covering the pot with a lid can reduce evaporation by trapping the steam inside. However, if the lid is not tight-fitting, steam can still escape, leading to evaporation.\n6. **Humidity**: Cooking in a humid environment can reduce evaporation, as the air is already saturated with water molecules. In dry environments, evaporation can occur more quickly.\n7. **Air circulation**: Good air circulation around the pot can enhance evaporation, as it helps to remove the steam more efficiently.\n8. **Water temperature**: Water at a higher temperature will evaporate more quickly than water at a lower temperature.\n9. **Altitude**: At higher elevations, the air pressure is lower, which can lead to faster evaporation.\n10. **Wind**: Cooking outdoors or in a drafty area can increase evaporation due to the wind blowing away the steam.\n\nBy understanding these factors, you can adjust your cooking technique and environment to minimize or maximize evaporation, depending on your desired outcome. 🍲"],"references":["물의 증발량은 라면 1개를 끓일 때와 2개를 끓일 때 거의 같다. 따라서, 라면을 2개를 끓일 때는 1100mL보다 적은 양의 물을 사용해도 된다.",null]}

Young people may feel pressure to present a perfect online image to gain validation and likes.\n2. **Influence of celebrity culture**: The widespread influence of celebrity culture and the idolization of social media influencers can create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and the desire to emulate their luxurious lifestyles.\n3. **Capitalist consumerism**: The emphasis on material possessions and consumerism in modern society can lead to a culture of conspicuous consumption, where people feel the need to display their wealth and status through social media.\n4. **Lack of self-esteem and identity**: Insecure individuals may use social media as a means to compensate for feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem, seeking validation and attention from others.\n5. **Fear of missing out (FOMO) and peer pressure**: The pressure to keep up with trends and maintain a certain image can lead to a sense of FOMO, driving young people to engage in conspicuous consumption and show off on social media.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Media literacy education**: Educate young people on how to critically evaluate social media content, recognize the curated nature of online profiles, and develop a healthy skepticism towards the information presented.\n2. **Promote authentic self-expression**: Encourage young people to focus on authentic self-expression and personal growth, rather than trying to present a perfect online image.\n3. **Foster a culture of minimalism and sustainability**: Promote a culture of minimalism, sustainability, and responsible consumption, highlighting the negative environmental and social impacts of excessive consumerism.\n4. **Encourage offline activities and hobbies**: Support and promote offline activities, hobbies, and interests that do not rely on social media validation, such as sports, art, or volunteering.\n5. **Mental health support**: Provide access to mental health resources and support services to help young people address underlying issues of low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression that may contribute to the desire to show off on social media.\n6. **Alternative social media platforms**: Develop and promote alternative social media platforms that prioritize real-life connections, meaningful interactions, and authentic self-expression over likes and followers.\n7. **Parental guidance and involvement**: Encourage parents to engage in open conversations with their children about the potential risks and consequences of social media use, and to set a good example by modeling healthy online behavior themselves.\n8. **Regulatory measures**: Implement regulatory measures to limit the influence of celebrity culture and consumerism on social media, such as stricter advertising regulations and taxes on luxury goods.\n\nBy addressing these underlying factors and promoting a more balanced and authentic approach to social media use, we can help young people develop a healthier relationship with social media and reduce the trend of conspicuous consumption and show-off culture.","From a capitalist perspective, one could argue that the phenomenon of young people using social media as a means of self-realization and showing off is not a problem, but rather a natural consequence of human nature and the free market. Here's a logical development of this argument:\n\n**Argument 1: Human nature and the desire for status**\n\nHumans have an inherent desire for status, recognition, and admiration from others. Social media platforms provide an efficient means for individuals to showcase their achievements, possessions, and experiences, thereby satisfying this fundamental human need. In a capitalist system, individuals are free to pursue their self-interest and maximize their utility, which in this case means accumulating social capital and status.\n\n**Argument 2: Free market and consumer choice**\n\nThe free market allows individuals to make choices about how they want to allocate their resources, including their time and money. If young people choose to spend their time and money on social media, luxury goods, and experiences to showcase their status, it is their prerogative. The market provides a platform for individuals to express their preferences, and businesses respond by offering products and services that cater to these desires.\n\n**Argument 3: Innovation and economic growth**\n\nThe desire for status and self-realization drives innovation and economic growth. Social media companies, luxury brands, and experience providers invest in research and development to create new products and services that cater to the demands of young people. This leads to job creation, economic growth, and increased competition, which ultimately benefits consumers.\n\n**Argument 4: Meritocracy and social mobility**\n\nIn a capitalist system, individuals are rewarded based on their skills, talents, and hard work. Social media provides a platform for individuals to demonstrate their abilities, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit. Those who are successful in showcasing their skills and achievements are more likely to attract opportunities, such as sponsorships, collaborations, and business deals. This meritocratic system allows individuals to climb the social ladder and achieve upward mobility.\n\n**Argument 5: Personal freedom and autonomy**\n\nIndividuals have the right to make choices about how they want to present themselves online and offline. If they choose to engage in conspicuous consumption or show off on social media, it is their personal decision. The government and society should not restrict individual freedom and autonomy by imposing regulations or moral judgments on how people choose to express themselves.\n\n**Counterarguments and responses**\n\n* **Counterargument:** Social media platforms create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, leading to negative social and environmental consequences.\n* **Response:** While it is true that social media can have negative consequences, it is up to individuals to make informed choices about their online behavior and consumption habits. The free market provides alternatives and incentives for sustainable and responsible consumption.\n* **Counterargument:** The emphasis on status and material possessions can lead to mental health issues and decreased well-being.\n* **Response:** While mental health is a concern, it is not the responsibility of the government or society to dictate how individuals should prioritize their well-being. Individuals must take personal responsibility for their mental health and make choices that align with their values and goals.\n\nIn conclusion, from a capitalist perspective, the phenomenon of young people using social media as a means of self-realization and showing off is a natural consequence of human nature and the free market. It drives innovation, economic growth, and social mobility, while promoting personal freedom and autonomy. While there may be negative consequences, it is up to individuals to make informed choices and take personal responsibility for their actions."],"references":[null,null]}

By opening 50 cabinets at a time, each employee can gather information about the distribution of the numbers and increase the chances of finding their own assigned cabinet.\n\nIt can be shown that this strategy gives a success probability of approximately 0.311, which is the highest possible probability of all employees finding their assigned cabinets.\n\nIt's worth noting that this problem is a classic example of a \"search problem\" and has been extensively studied in the field of computer science and operations research.","When the number of employees is 30 and each employee can open 15 cabinets, the optimal strategy is slightly different from the one I described earlier.\n\nIn this case, the optimal strategy is to use a \"group testing\" approach. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 30 employees into 2 groups of 15 employees each.\n2. The first group of 15 employees opens 15 cabinets, and the second group of 15 employees opens the remaining 15 cabinets.\n3. If any employee in the first group finds their assigned cabinet, they announce the number to the entire group.\n4. The second group of employees then opens the cabinets that were not opened by the first group, but only if the first group did not find their assigned cabinet. If the first group found their cabinet, the second group opens the same 15 cabinets as the first group.\n5. This process continues until all employees have opened 15 cabinets or all employees have found their assigned cabinets.\n\nThis strategy is known as the \"group testing strategy\" and it can be shown that it maximizes the probability of all employees finding their assigned cabinets.\n\nUsing this strategy, the probability of all employees finding their assigned cabinets is approximately 0.428, which is higher than the probability of 0.311 obtained by the optimal adaptive strategy when each employee can open 50 cabinets.\n\nThe group testing strategy is particularly effective when the number of employees is smaller and each employee can open a smaller number of cabinets. It's a clever way to use the limited number of cabinet openings to gather information and increase the chances of finding the assigned cabinets."],"references":["이 문제는 원순열(순환이 이루어지는 순열)을 이용해서 풀 수 있다. 해당 전략을 이용하면 (1\/2)^100의 확률을 약 0.31까지 올릴 수 있다.","유효하다."]}

As a space traveler who has left Earth behind, I'd like to approach this diary entry by reflecting on the nostalgia and longing I feel for my home planet. Here's a possible approach and a written diary entry:\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Sensory recall**: I'll start by recalling the sensory experiences I had on Earth, such as the smell of fresh air, the sound of birds chirping, or the feeling of sand between my toes.\n2. **Emotional reflection**: I'll reflect on the emotions I associate with Earth, like the sense of belonging, the comfort of familiarity, and the joy of connection with loved ones.\n3. **Comparative analysis**: I'll compare my current life in space to my life on Earth, highlighting the differences and similarities that evoke feelings of nostalgia.\n4. **Personal anecdotes**: I'll share specific stories or memories that are etched in my mind, which will help to illustrate my longing for Earth.\n\n**Diary Entry:**\n\n**Entry 234, Galactic Date 2256-02-15**\n\nI'm sitting in my quarters, surrounded by the hum of machinery and the endless expanse of stars outside my window. It's been 20 years since I left Earth, and yet, the ache of homesickness still lingers. Today, I caught myself wondering what the sky looked like on a sunny day, or the taste of a freshly picked apple from my grandfather's orchard.\n\nI remember the smell of rain on dry soil, the way it would fill my lungs and invigorate my senses. Here, in the sterile environment of our spacecraft, the air is recycled and odorless. It's a small thing, but it's these tiny details that make me feel like a part of me is missing.\n\nI miss the sound of laughter, of children playing in the park, of music drifting from a neighbor's window. The silence of space is deafening, punctuated only by the occasional beep or hiss of our ship's systems. Sometimes, I find myself straining to hear the sound of a bird's song, just to remind myself that I'm not completely alone.\n\nI've tried to recreate the comforts of home in my quarters – a holographic display of a sunset, a virtual fireplace, even a simulated gravity setting to mimic the feeling of walking on Earth's surface. But it's not the same. It's like trying to recreate a work of art by describing it to someone; the essence is lost in translation.\n\nI think about my family, my friends, the people I left behind. I wonder what they're doing, if they're thinking of me, if they're looking up at the same stars I am. The distance between us feels like an insurmountable chasm, and I'm left with only my memories to bridge the gap.\n\nAs I look out into the vastness of space, I'm reminded of the beauty and wonder that brought me here in the first place. But tonight, it's not enough. Tonight, I just want to go home.\n\n**End of Entry**\n\nThis diary entry is just a starting point, and I can continue to add more entries, exploring different themes and emotions. The key is to tap into the nostalgia and longing, and to use sensory details to bring the memories to life.","What a great question! Writing a space traveler's diary can be more challenging than writing a diary from an Earth-based perspective in several ways:\n\n1. **Unfamiliar environment**: A space traveler's surroundings are vastly different from those on Earth. The lack of familiar landmarks, climate, and sensory experiences can make it harder to draw inspiration from their environment.\n2. **Limited sensory input**: In space, the senses are limited by the confines of the spacecraft or habitat. The absence of natural light, fresh air, and varied sounds can make it difficult to describe and evoke emotions.\n3. **Disconnection from nature**: Space travelers are disconnected from the natural world, which can make it harder to tap into the emotional resonance that comes from being part of an ecosystem.\n4. **Unrelatable experiences**: The experiences of a space traveler may be so alien (pun intended) to readers that it's challenging to create a sense of relatability or empathy.\n5. **Lack of cultural references**: Space travelers may not have access to the same cultural touchstones, such as music, literature, or art, that can provide a sense of comfort and familiarity.\n6. **Time dilation and isolation**: Space travel can involve time dilation, which can affect the traveler's perception of time. This, combined with the isolation of being in space, can make it difficult to maintain a sense of continuity and connection to the past.\n7. **Technological mediation**: The space traveler's experiences may be heavily mediated by technology, which can create a sense of detachment from the world around them.\n8. **Psychological factors**: The psychological effects of long-term space travel, such as cabin fever, can impact the traveler's mental state and ability to reflect on their experiences.\n9. **Language barriers**: The language and terminology used in space travel may be highly specialized, making it difficult for non-experts to understand and relate to the experiences described.\n10. **The burden of representation**: A space traveler's diary may be seen as representative of an entire community or generation, adding pressure to convey the experiences and emotions accurately.\n\nBy acknowledging these challenges, a writer can better prepare themselves to tackle the unique difficulties of writing a space traveler's diary and create a more authentic and engaging narrative."],"references":[null,null]}

Not only will this approach enhance user satisfaction, but it will also have a profoundly positive impact on company revenue.\n\nFirst and foremost, a premium subscription model will attract a loyal customer base willing to pay for an ad-free experience. According to a recent survey, 70% of users are willing to pay for ad-free content, demonstrating a clear demand for this type of service. By catering to this demand, companies can tap into a new revenue stream, generating significant income from subscription fees. Moreover, this loyal customer base will be more likely to recommend the service to others, driving organic growth and reducing customer acquisition costs.\n\nFurthermore, an ad-free experience will lead to increased user engagement and retention rates. Without the distraction of ads, users will be more focused on the content, leading to longer session times and higher levels of satisfaction. This, in turn, will result in higher retention rates, as users are more likely to continue using a service that provides a seamless and enjoyable experience. With higher retention rates, companies can reduce the costs associated with acquiring new customers, further boosting revenue.\n\nIn addition, a premium subscription model will provide companies with a more stable and predictable revenue stream. Unlike advertising revenue, which can be volatile and subject to fluctuations in ad spend, subscription fees provide a steady income that can be relied upon. This stability will enable companies to invest in improving their services, driving innovation and further enhancing the user experience.\n\nAnother significant benefit of a premium subscription model is the opportunity to collect valuable user data. Without the need to rely on third-party ad networks, companies can collect and utilize user data in a more targeted and effective manner, providing a more personalized experience and increasing the overall value proposition.\n\nFinally, introducing a premium subscription model will send a strong message to users about the value of the service. By offering a premium, ad-free experience, companies are signaling that they are committed to providing a high-quality service that is worth paying for. This will enhance the brand's reputation and increase user trust, leading to long-term loyalty and advocacy.\n\nIn conclusion, introducing a premium subscription model that eliminates ads is a strategic move that can have a profoundly positive impact on company revenue. By catering to the growing demand for ad-free experiences, companies can attract a loyal customer base, increase user engagement and retention, and generate a stable and predictable revenue stream. It is time for online services to embrace a premium future, one that is free from ads and focused on providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.","Here are some potential reactions from existing users who have been using the free service when a premium subscription model is introduced:\n\n**Positive Reactions:**\n\n1. **Relief and appreciation**: Some users may be relieved that they can finally get rid of ads and enjoy a seamless experience. They may appreciate the option to upgrade to a premium subscription and be willing to pay for it.\n2. **Loyalty and commitment**: Users who have been loyal to the service may see the premium subscription as a way to support the company and ensure its continued existence. They may be willing to pay for the premium service as a way to show their commitment.\n3. **Upgraded experience**: Users who value the service and want to get the most out of it may be excited to upgrade to a premium subscription, which offers additional features, improved performance, or exclusive content.\n\n**Negative Reactions:**\n\n1. **Resistance to change**: Some users may resist the change and feel that the service is no longer free. They may feel that they are being forced to pay for something that was previously free.\n2. **Price sensitivity**: Users who are sensitive to price may be deterred by the cost of the premium subscription, especially if they are not convinced of its value.\n3. **Loss of perceived value**: Users who have been using the free service may feel that the premium subscription is not worth the cost, especially if they don't see significant benefits or improvements.\n4. **Anger and frustration**: Some users may feel angry or frustrated that the service is no longer free, especially if they have been using it for a long time. They may feel that the company is abandoning its original promise of a free service.\n5. **Migration to alternative services**: Users who are unhappy with the introduction of a premium subscription may seek alternative services that offer similar features for free or at a lower cost.\n\n**Neutral Reactions:**\n\n1. **Indifference**: Some users may not care about the introduction of a premium subscription and continue to use the free service with ads.\n2. **Wait-and-see approach**: Users may take a wait-and-see approach, observing how the premium subscription model works out before deciding whether to upgrade or not.\n3. **Free trial or demo**: Users may request a free trial or demo of the premium subscription to test its features and benefits before committing to a paid plan.\n\nIt's essential to communicate the value proposition of the premium subscription clearly and transparently to existing users, highlighting the benefits and improvements it offers. This can help to mitigate negative reactions and encourage users to upgrade to the premium service."],"references":[null,null]}

Let's imagine how Karl Marx, the author of Das Kapital, would view the phenomenon of Bitcoin's rapid surge and its implications on modern society.\n\n**Marx's perspective on Bitcoin**\n\nMarx would likely view Bitcoin as a manifestation of the contradictions inherent in the capitalist system. He would argue that the rise of Bitcoin is a symptom of the instability and volatility of the global financial system, which is driven by the pursuit of profit and the concentration of wealth.\n\nMarx would likely see Bitcoin as a form of \"fictitious capital,\" a concept he introduced in Das Kapital to describe the way in which capital is created and accumulated through financial speculation and manipulation, rather than through the production of real value. In this sense, Bitcoin's value is not based on any tangible asset or productive activity, but rather on speculation and the expectation of future profits.\n\nMarx would also argue that the decentralized and anonymous nature of Bitcoin is an illusion, as it is still subject to the whims of the market and the interests of powerful actors who seek to manipulate its value. He would contend that the supposed \"democratization\" of finance through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is, in reality, a means of further concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals and institutions.\n\n**Marx's analysis of modern society**\n\nFrom Marx's perspective, the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a reflection of the deeper contradictions and crises of modern capitalist society. He would argue that the increasing inequality, instability, and uncertainty of the global economy are driving people to seek alternative forms of investment and speculation, such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nMarx would contend that the root cause of these problems lies in the capitalist system itself, which is based on the exploitation of labor and the pursuit of profit above all else. He would argue that the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals and corporations has led to a system of \"crony capitalism,\" in which the interests of the ruling class are prioritized over those of the majority.\n\nIn this context, Marx would see the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a desperate attempt to find a way out of the crisis, but one that ultimately perpetuates the same dynamics of exploitation and inequality. He would argue that the only way to truly address the problems of modern society is through a fundamental transformation of the economic system, one that prioritizes the needs and well-being of the many over the interests of the few.\n\n**Marx's critique of the \"crypto-utopia\"**\n\nMarx would likely be critical of the idea that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can create a more equitable and democratic society. He would argue that the notion of a \"crypto-utopia\" is a fantasy, and that the decentralized and anonymous nature of these systems is illusory.\n\nMarx would contend that the crypto-utopian vision of a world without governments or institutions is a myth, and that the reality is that these systems are still subject to the same power dynamics and interests as the traditional financial system. He would argue that the idea of a \"decentralized\" system is a myth, and that the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few individuals and institutions is still the dominant reality.\n\nIn conclusion, Marx would likely view the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a symptom of the deeper contradictions and crises of modern capitalist society. He would argue that the only way to truly address these problems is through a fundamental transformation of the economic system, one that prioritizes the needs and well-being of the many over the interests of the few.","Analyzing modern society's problems from Karl Marx's perspective can be challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. **Contextual differences**: Marx wrote in the 19th century, and his ideas were shaped by the industrial capitalism of his time. Modern society has undergone significant changes, such as the rise of service-oriented economies, globalization, and the digital revolution. Applying Marx's ideas to contemporary issues requires careful consideration of these contextual differences.\n2. **Complexity of modern capitalism**: Modern capitalism is more complex and nuanced than the industrial capitalism Marx critiqued. The rise of finance capitalism, neoliberalism, and the gig economy, among other factors, have created a more intricate system that may not fit neatly into Marx's original framework.\n3. **New forms of exploitation**: Marx focused on the exploitation of labor in the industrial era. However, modern society has seen the emergence of new forms of exploitation, such as data exploitation, platform capitalism, and environmental degradation, which may not be directly addressed in Marx's work.\n4. **Globalization and international relations**: Marx's analysis was largely focused on national economies and class struggles within them. Modern society is characterized by globalization, international trade, and complex global supply chains, which require a more nuanced understanding of international relations and global power dynamics.\n5. **Role of technology**: Marx did not anticipate the impact of technology on the economy and society. The rise of automation, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms has transformed the nature of work, production, and distribution, making it challenging to apply Marx's ideas directly.\n6. **Changing nature of class and identity**: Marx's concept of class was based on the industrial proletariat and bourgeoisie. Modern society has seen the emergence of new social classes, identities, and forms of oppression, such as intersectionality, which may not fit neatly into Marx's class-based analysis.\n7. **Criticisms and revisions of Marx's ideas**: Marx's work has been subject to various criticisms and revisions over the years. Some argue that his ideas are outdated, while others have attempted to update and adapt his theories to modern circumstances. This diversity of perspectives can make it challenging to identify a single, authoritative Marxian perspective.\n8. **Interdisciplinary approaches**: Marx's work was primarily focused on economics and politics. Modern social problems often require an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from fields like sociology, psychology, environmental studies, and cultural studies, which may not be directly addressed in Marx's work.\n9. **Normative and prescriptive aspects**: Marx's work was not only analytical but also normative and prescriptive, aiming to inspire revolutionary change. Modern social problems often require a more nuanced and context-specific approach, which may not fit neatly into Marx's revolutionary framework.\n10. **Balancing critique and solution**: Marx's work is often criticized for being overly critical and lacking concrete solutions. Analyzing modern social problems from a Marxian perspective requires striking a balance between critiquing the existing system and proposing viable alternatives.\n\nBy acknowledging these challenges, researchers and scholars can engage in a more nuanced and informed discussion about the relevance and applicability of Marx's ideas to modern social problems."],"references":[null,null]}

It's a way to analyze the performance of an algorithm, helping us understand how it will scale as the input size increases.\n\n**How to Calculate Time Complexity**\n\nTo calculate time complexity, we need to identify the operations performed by the algorithm and count the number of times each operation is executed. We can then express the time complexity using Big O notation, which gives an upper bound on the number of operations.\n\nHere are some common operations and their time complexities:\n\n* Assignment: O(1)\n* Arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, multiplication): O(1)\n* Loop: O(n), where n is the number of iterations\n* Nested loops: O(n^2), O(n^3), etc.\n* Array or list access: O(1)\n* Recursive function calls: O(2^n), O(n!), etc.\n\nTo calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the operations performed by the algorithm.\n2. Count the number of times each operation is executed.\n3. Express the time complexity using Big O notation.\n\n**Examples of Optimization Techniques**\n\nHere are some examples of optimization techniques that reduce time complexity:\n\n1. **Memoization**: Store the results of expensive function calls to avoid recalculating them.\n\nExample: Fibonacci sequence calculation\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    memo = {0: 0, 1: 1}\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2]\n    return memo[n]\n```\nTime complexity: O(n) (without memoization: O(2^n))\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: Break down a problem into smaller subproblems and store the solutions to subproblems to avoid recalculating them.\n\nExample: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem\n```python\ndef lcs(x, y):\n    m, n = len(x), len(y)\n    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]\n    for i in range(m+1):\n        for j in range(n+1):\n            if i == 0 or j == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = 0\n            elif x[i-1] == y[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n    return dp[m][n]\n```\nTime complexity: O(mn) (without dynamic programming: O(2^(m+n)))\n\n3. **Hashing**: Use a hash table to store and retrieve data in constant time.\n\nExample: Finding duplicates in an array\n```python\ndef find_duplicates(arr):\n    seen = set()\n    duplicates = []\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            duplicates.append(num)\n        seen.add(num)\n    return duplicates\n```\nTime complexity: O(n) (without hashing: O(n^2))\n\n4. **Binary Search**: Reduce the search space by half with each iteration.\n\nExample: Finding an element in a sorted array\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) \/\/ 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```\nTime complexity: O(log n) (without binary search: O(n))\n\nThese are just a few examples of optimization techniques that can reduce time complexity. By applying these techniques, you can make your algorithms more efficient and scalable.","😊\n\n**Time Complexity vs. Space Complexity**\n\nIn computer science, we analyze the performance of algorithms using two main metrics: time complexity and space complexity.\n\n**Time Complexity** (시간 복잡도) measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, usually expressed as a function of the size of the input. It's a measure of how long an algorithm takes to execute.\n\n**Space Complexity** (공간 복잡도) measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses, usually expressed as a function of the size of the input. It's a measure of how much memory an algorithm requires to execute.\n\nIn other words, time complexity focuses on the **execution time**, while space complexity focuses on the **memory usage**.\n\n**Why are both important?**\n\n1. **Time complexity**: A fast algorithm with high time complexity might be inefficient for large inputs, leading to slow performance or even crashes.\n2. **Space complexity**: An algorithm with high space complexity might consume too much memory, leading to memory errors, slow performance, or even crashes.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. **Time complexity**:\n\t* An algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) might be slow for large inputs, while an algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n) might be much faster.\n2. **Space complexity**:\n\t* An algorithm that uses a lot of memory to store intermediate results might have a high space complexity, while an algorithm that uses a small amount of memory might have a low space complexity.\n\n**Trade-offs**:\n\nIn many cases, there's a trade-off between time complexity and space complexity. For example:\n\n* An algorithm with a low time complexity might use more memory (high space complexity) to achieve faster execution.\n* An algorithm with a low space complexity might take longer to execute (high time complexity) to conserve memory.\n\n**Real-world examples:**\n\n1. **Caching**: A web application might use caching to reduce the time complexity of database queries, but this might increase the space complexity due to the memory required to store the cache.\n2. **Compression**: Compressing data can reduce the space complexity, but it might increase the time complexity due to the computational overhead of compression and decompression.\n\nBy considering both time complexity and space complexity, you can design and optimize algorithms that balance performance, memory usage, and scalability. 💻"],"references":[null,null]}

This means that if you only send a partial update, the server will overwrite the entire resource with the partial data, potentially losing data.\n* **Idempotent**: PUT is an idempotent method, meaning that making the same request multiple times will have the same effect as making it once. This is because you're replacing the entire resource, so it doesn't matter how many times you do it.\n* **Example**: Updating a user's entire profile information, including name, email, and address.\n\n**PATCH**\n\n* **Partial update**: When you send a PATCH request, you're sending a partial update to the resource, and the server will apply the changes to the existing resource. This means you can update only specific fields without affecting the rest of the resource.\n* **Not idempotent**: PATCH is not an idempotent method, meaning that making the same request multiple times can have different effects. This is because you're applying a delta to the resource, and repeated applications can accumulate.\n* **Example**: Updating a user's email address only, without touching the rest of their profile information.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider a user resource with the following properties:\n\n* `name`: John\n* `email`: john@example.com\n* `address`: 123 Main St\n\nIf you send a PUT request with the following data:\n\n* `name`: Jane\n* `email`: jane@example.com\n\nThe server will replace the entire resource with the new data, resulting in:\n\n* `name`: Jane\n* `email`: jane@example.com\n* `address`: null (lost the original address)\n\nOn the other hand, if you send a PATCH request with the following data:\n\n* `email`: jane@example.com\n\nThe server will update only the `email` field, resulting in:\n\n* `name`: John\n* `email`: jane@example.com\n* `address`: 123 Main St (preserved the original address)\n\nIn summary, use PUT when you need to replace the entire resource, and use PATCH when you need to apply a partial update to the resource. 💻"],"references":["GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, CONNECT 중 5개를 설명","PUT은 전체를 업데이트하는 반면, PATCH는 일부를 업데이트한다."]}

We create an empty dictionary `char_count` to store the count of each character in the input list.\n2. We iterate through the input list and update the count of each character in the dictionary. If a character is already in the dictionary, we increment its count by 1. If it's not in the dictionary, we add it with a count of 1.\n3. We iterate through the input list again and return the first character that has a count of 1 in the dictionary. This is the first unique character in the list.\n\nHere are some test cases to demonstrate the function:\n```\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd']))  # Output: 'b'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'c'\nprint(find_unique_character(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']))  # Output: 'a'\n```\nNote that this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we iterate through the list twice. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use a single iteration and keep track of the first unique character seen so far. Here's an updated implementation:\n```\ndef find_unique_character(characters):\n    char_count = {}\n    first_unique = None\n    for char in characters:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n            if first_unique is None:\n                first_unique = char\n    return first_unique\n```\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n) and returns the first unique character in a single iteration.","Here are some ways to increase the difficulty of the problem:\n\n1. **Case insensitivity**: Make the function case-insensitive, so that 'A' and 'a' are considered the same character.\n2. **Non-ASCII characters**: Include non-ASCII characters in the input list, such as accented letters, emojis, or characters from non-Latin scripts.\n3. **Large input size**: Increase the size of the input list to thousands or millions of characters, making the function's efficiency a critical factor.\n4. **Multiple unique characters**: Instead of returning the first unique character, return all unique characters in the list, or return the k-th unique character.\n5. **Stream processing**: Instead of receiving the entire list as input, process the characters one by one, and return the first unique character as soon as it is encountered.\n6. **Memory constraints**: Impose a memory limit on the function, so that it cannot use more than a certain amount of memory to store the character counts.\n7. **Time complexity constraints**: Impose a time complexity constraint, such as O(n\/2) or O(log n), making the function's efficiency a critical factor.\n8. **Input validation**: Add input validation to handle edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with only one element, or a list with all duplicate characters.\n9. **Character encoding**: Use a specific character encoding, such as UTF-16 or UTF-32, and require the function to handle characters that are not representable in the encoding.\n10. **Multithreading or parallel processing**: Require the function to be thread-safe or parallelizable, so that it can take advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n\nHere's an example of how the problem statement could be modified to incorporate some of these challenges:\n\n**Problem statement:**\n\nWrite a function `find_unique_character` that takes a stream of characters as input and returns the first unique character in the stream. The function should be case-insensitive, handle non-ASCII characters, and process the characters one by one. The input stream may contain up to 1 million characters, and the function should use no more than 1 MB of memory. The function should return the result in O(n\/2) time complexity.\n\n**Example inputs:**\n\n* `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd']`\n* `['😊', '👍', '😊', '🤔', '👀']`\n* `['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']`\n\n**Example outputs:**\n\n* `'b'`\n* `🤔`\n* `'c'`"],"references":[null,null]}

He claims that deep work allows individuals to push their cognitive abilities to the limit, create new value, improve skills, and make themselves difficult to replace.\n\nThe text does not suggest that the automation of work is a factor that enables deep work. Instead, it suggests that automation may replace shallow work, making deep work even more valuable.\n\nAs for Newport's perspective on deep work, he views it as a superpower in our economy, which allows individuals to achieve great things, create new value, and improve their skills. He also argues that deep work can lead to increased productivity, satisfaction, and well-being, as it allows individuals to fully engage in their work and experience a sense of flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 작업의 자동화 증가, which is not a factor that enables deep work according to Newport's perspective.","Today's education system is not adequately supporting students in developing their deep work abilities, and there are several factors that hinder the acquisition of this skill. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. **Overemphasis on multitasking**: Modern education often encourages students to multitask, switching between multiple tasks and devices simultaneously. This can lead to a culture of distraction, making it difficult for students to focus on a single task for an extended period.\n2. **Fragmented learning**: The curriculum is often broken down into smaller, manageable chunks, which can lead to a lack of depth and coherence in learning. This can make it challenging for students to engage in deep, meaningful work.\n3. **Technology addiction**: The widespread use of technology in education can be a double-edged sword. While it provides access to a vast amount of information, it can also be a significant distraction, leading to a lack of focus and attention.\n4. **Pressure to perform**: The emphasis on standardized testing and grades can create a culture of anxiety and stress, leading students to focus on short-term performance rather than deep learning.\n5. **Lack of autonomy**: Students are often not given the freedom to choose their own topics or projects, which can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement.\n6. **Insufficient feedback**: Feedback is often limited to grades or superficial comments, rather than providing students with meaningful, constructive feedback that can help them improve their work.\n7. **Overreliance on extrinsic motivation**: The education system often relies on external motivators such as grades, rewards, and punishments, rather than encouraging intrinsic motivation and a love of learning.\n8. **Inadequate time management skills**: Students are not taught effective time management skills, leading to poor prioritization and a lack of focus.\n9. **Distractions in the classroom**: Classrooms can be filled with distractions, such as social media, email, and text messages, which can make it difficult for students to focus.\n10. **Lack of role models**: Teachers and educators may not model deep work behaviors themselves, making it challenging for students to learn from them.\n\nTo support students in developing their deep work abilities, educators can:\n\n1. Encourage students to work on long-term projects that require sustained focus.\n2. Provide opportunities for students to choose their own topics and projects.\n3. Teach effective time management and prioritization skills.\n4. Create a distraction-free learning environment.\n5. Encourage students to reflect on their own learning and set goals.\n6. Provide meaningful, constructive feedback that encourages students to improve their work.\n7. Model deep work behaviors themselves.\n8. Encourage students to take breaks and practice self-care to reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nBy addressing these factors, educators can help students develop the skills and habits necessary for deep work, leading to more meaningful learning and better preparation for success in the 21st century."],"references":["B",null]}

What I love about Japchae is its unique texture and flavor profile. The sweet potato starch noodles, also known as \"dangmyeon,\" have a chewy and slightly sweet texture that pairs perfectly with the savory flavors of the beef and vegetables.\n\nOne of the standout features of Japchae is its versatility. The dish can be served as a main course, side dish, or even as a snack. It's also a very customizable dish, allowing you to add or subtract ingredients to suit your taste preferences. For example, you can add more vegetables like spinach, carrots, or bell peppers to make it a healthier option, or add more meat for a heartier meal.\n\nThe flavor of Japchae is a perfect balance of sweet, savory, and umami. The sweet potato starch noodles absorb the flavors of the soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil, while the beef adds a rich and meaty flavor. The vegetables add a pop of color and freshness to the dish, making it a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds.\n\nTo make Japchae, you'll need the following ingredients: 200g of sweet potato starch noodles, 100g of beef (sirloin or ribeye work well), 1 onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 cup of spinach, 1 cup of mushrooms, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Simply stir-fry the beef and vegetables in a pan, then add the noodles and seasonings, and stir-fry everything together until the noodles are well coated.\n\nOverall, Japchae is a delicious and satisfying dish that never fails to hit the spot. Its unique texture, customizable ingredients, and balanced flavors make it a must-try for anyone looking to explore Korean cuisine.

Here are two of the most representative ones:\n\n1. **Apple**: In modern Korean, \"사과\" is commonly used to refer to an apple, the fruit. This meaning is widely used in everyday conversation, and you can find it in supermarkets, restaurants, and even in fruit markets.\n2. **Apology**: In a more formal or traditional sense, \"사과\" means \"apology\" or \"regret.\" In this context, it's often used in formal writing, such as in official documents, news articles, or in formal speeches. For example, \"저는 사과드립니다\" (jeoneun sagwadeulbni-da) means \"I apologize.\"\n\nThese two meanings are quite distinct, and the context usually makes it clear which one is intended. However, it's interesting to note that the word \"사과\" has evolved over time, and its meanings have branched out in different ways.","😊\n\nIn linguistics, \"동음이의어\" (dong-eum-i-eo) and \"다의어\" (da-ui-eo) are two related but distinct concepts:\n\n**동음이의어 (Dong-eum-i-eo)**: Homophones\n\n* Refers to words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings and often different characters or spellings.\n* The words may or may not be related in meaning.\n* Examples:\n\t+ \"bank\" (financial institution) and \"bank\" (slope or incline)\n\t+ \"bow\" (front of a ship) and \"bow\" (ribbon tied around a package)\n\n**다의어 (Da-ui-eo)**: Polysemy\n\n* Refers to a single word that has multiple related or unrelated meanings.\n* The word has the same spelling and\/or pronunciation, but the meanings are distinct.\n* Examples:\n\t+ \"head\" (upper part of the body) and \"head\" (source of a river)\n\t+ \"사과\" (apple) and \"사과\" (apology)\n\nThe key difference lies in the number of words involved:\n\n* Homophones involve multiple words with the same pronunciation but different meanings.\n* Polysemy involves a single word with multiple meanings.\n\nIn the case of \"사과\", it's an example of polysemy, as it's a single word with two distinct meanings: apple and apology."],"references":["아래 뜻 중 두 가지 이상 언급했으면 정답으로 인정.\n1. 자기의 잘못을 인정하고 용서를 빎. 2.

These words are often related to everyday life, nature, and traditional Korean culture.\n\nThis is because Korean language has been heavily influenced by Chinese culture and language throughout its history, especially during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. As a result, many Chinese characters (hanja) were adopted into the Korean language, and new words were created by combining these characters.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in promoting the use of native Korean words and reducing the reliance on Sino-Korean words, especially in formal and official contexts."],"references":["너희들이 그 모양이니 [발전]이 없는 거야. 에서 '발전'","한자어"]}
